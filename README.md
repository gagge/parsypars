# Parsypars
A small test perser for metry.

## Installation

First you need to install all packages through npm
```
npm install
```
Then we need to build the code
```
npm run build
```

## Usage

After installation you just run the script with two arguments. First the vendor of the Invoice and then the path to the source file. Something like this.

```
npm start adven ./storage/source.txt
```

Now the imported data hopefully will be found in ./storage/invoices.json
